# Denisetiya Portfolio - Developer Guide

## Project Overview

This is a modern, performance-optimized portfolio website for Denisetiya, a Full Stack Developer. The project showcases a professional portfolio with comprehensive SEO optimization, accessibility features, and multi-language support.

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.0
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom animations
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Animations**: React InScroll (performance-optimized alternative to Framer Motion)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.8

## Project Structure

### Core Directories
- `src/components/fragment/` - Main page sections (Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, Contact)
- `src/components/layout/` - Layout components (Header, Footer)
- `src/components/widget/` - Reusable UI widgets (LoadingScreen, ScrollProgress, BackToTop, CustomCursor, LanguageToggle)
- `src/contexts/` - React contexts for theme and language management
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/pages/` - Page components
- `public/` - Static assets including SEO files (manifest.json, sitemap.xml, robots.txt)

### Key Files
- `index.html` - Comprehensive SEO meta tags, structured data (JSON-LD), and performance optimizations
- `vite.config.ts` - Build optimization with manual chunking and performance settings
- `tailwind.config.js` - Custom animations and theme configuration
- `package.json` - Modern dependencies with React 19 and latest tooling

## Development Best Practices

### Component Architecture
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript
- Follow the fragment/layout/widget component organization pattern
- Use React contexts for global state (theme, language)
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (useTheme, useLanguage, useScroll)

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Implement dark mode support with `dark:` prefixes
- Custom animations defined in `tailwind.config.js`
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility

### Performance Optimizations
- Manual chunk splitting in Vite config for optimal bundle sizes
- React InScroll for lightweight scroll animations
- Preconnect and DNS prefetch for external resources
- Optimized image loading and compression
- Source maps disabled for production builds

### SEO & Accessibility
- Comprehensive meta tags including Open Graph and Twitter Cards
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for search engines
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- WCAG compliance with focus states and reduced motion support
- Multi-language support (English, Indonesian, Japanese)
- Sitemap and robots.txt for search engine crawling

### Internationalization (i18n)
- Language context with translation system
- Support for 3 languages: English (en), Indonesian (id), Japanese (jp)
- Translation keys organized by feature/section
- Language selector component in header
- URL parameter support for language switching

### Theme Management
- Light/dark mode toggle with system preference detection
- Theme persistence in localStorage
- Tailwind CSS v4 data-theme attribute support
- Smooth transitions between themes

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev          # Start development server on port 5173

# Build & Preview
npm run build        # TypeScript compilation + Vite build
npm run preview      # Preview production build on port 3000

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # ESLint with TypeScript support
```

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict TypeScript settings enabled
- Separate configs for app and Node.js code
- React 19 types included

### ESLint Configuration
- Modern ESLint flat config format
- TypeScript ESLint integration
- React Hooks and React Refresh plugins
- Browser globals configured

### File Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `LoadingScreen.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useTheme.ts`)
- Contexts: PascalCase with `Context` suffix (e.g., `ThemeContext.tsx`)
- Pages: PascalCase (e.g., `Home.tsx`)

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Optimization
- Vendor libraries chunked separately (React, React DOM)
- Router and animation libraries in separate chunks
- Icons library isolated for better caching
- Chunk size warning limit set to 500KB

### Animation Strategy
- React InScroll for scroll-triggered animations
- CSS-based animations for better performance
- Custom Tailwind animations for micro-interactions
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

### Loading Strategy
- Loading screen with 2-second delay
- Smooth scroll behavior for navigation
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Lazy loading considerations for images

## Deployment & SEO

### Production Optimizations
- Minification enabled for JS and CSS
- Compression reporting enabled
- Security headers in HTML
- Content Security Policy configured

### SEO Features
- Complete meta tag coverage
- Structured data for person and website schemas
- Multi-language sitemap with hreflang
- Social media optimization (Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Search engine verification ready

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Sections
1. Create component in `src/components/fragment/`
2. Add translation keys to `LanguageContext.tsx`
3. Import and use in `Home.tsx`
4. Add navigation link to `Header.tsx`

### Adding New Languages
1. Add language code to `Language` type in `LanguageContext.tsx`
2. Add translations for all existing keys
3. Update language selector options
4. Update sitemap.xml with new hreflang entries

### Customizing Animations
1. Define keyframes in `tailwind.config.js`
2. Add animation classes to theme.extend.animation
3. Use with Tailwind classes or React InScroll

### Theme Customization
1. Modify colors in `tailwind.config.js`
2. Update CSS custom properties if needed
3. Ensure dark mode variants are included
4. Test accessibility contrast ratios
